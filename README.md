# Star Wars EJS Site
This is an EJS website I built for practice in my Client Server Web Development class. 
It has many things like a Home page, About page, Contact page and a template page to display Star Wars movies.

The Star Wars movie data is stored in a Json file and passed through to the site.

The posters for the movies are displayed in a grid, ordered chronologically, where you can hover on a poster to view the movie's title in it's entirety.
